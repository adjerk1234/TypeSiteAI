TypeSite AI

TypeSite AI is a web application that enables registered users to build and organize multiple websites by interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM) in natural language, in real time. Users can create, edit, and manage website sections and templates, all while previewing their changes live.

Overview

TypeSite AI leverages the Node.js, Express, and MongoDB stack to provide a robust backend, while using EJS for templating and Bootstrap for responsive design. The application is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible even to users with a non-technical background.

Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the application.

Express: Web server framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data, websites, and pages.

Mongoose: MongoDB ORM for Node.js.

bcrypt: Library for hashing passwords.

dotenv: Module to load environment variables from a .env file.

nodemon: Tool for automatically restarting the node application when file changes are detected.
